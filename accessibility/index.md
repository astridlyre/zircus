## general

We strive to ensure that our services are accessible to people with
disabilities. We have invested a significant amount of resources to help ensure
that our website is made easier to use and more accessible for people with
disabilities, with the strong belief that every person has the right to live
with dignity, equality, comfort and independence. We are taking measures to
ensure that all of the pages on our website meet W3C WAI’s most recent Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines, Levels A and AA.

## disclaimer

We continue our efforts to constantly improve the accessibility of our site and
services in the belief that it is our collective moral obligation to allow
seamless, accessible and unhindered use also for those of us with disabilities.

Despite our efforts to make all pages and content on zircus.com fully
accessible, this is a work in progress. To the extent any content is not fully
accessible, this may be a result of zircus.com not having found or identified
the most appropriate technological solution. Under such circumstances, we will
work diligently to remedy any inaccessibility.
