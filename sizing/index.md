It is important to measure yourself and not go from clothing sizes since fit
can vary quite a lot from brand to brand. To ensure a great fit for your new
pair of underwear please follow these directions and choose your
corresponding size.

Take measurements while in your underwear, the measurement will be
inaccurate if taken over clothing. Stand flat on your feet while holding a
natural posture. Getting someone else to measure you would be easiest to
tell if the measuring tape is level to the floor.

Measure the circumference of your hips making sure the tape is over the
largest part of your buttocks. This will be lower than where your pants sit.
Start at one hip and wrap the tape measure around your rear, around the
other hip, and back to where you started. Because it is difficult to make
sure the tape is level behind you, you can use a mirror to check.
