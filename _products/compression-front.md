Our compression front briefs offer a layer of power-net, in-between 2 layers of
stretch cotton fabric: the comfort of cotton and the hold of power-net all in
one. With an extra wide (nearly 5" wide at the smallest point) style, your
thunder will be safely contained! The end result is a flat look, perfect for
smoothing things over. Each pair has a 1.25" wide white-on-black Zircus
waistband, black elastic trim, and 95% cotton 5% spandex fabric that is Oeko-Tex
Certified
