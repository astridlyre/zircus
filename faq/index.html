        As we aim to ship your order as quickly as possible, we regret that it

        an order has been submitted. Please ensure that you have verified your
        order details prior to submission, especially the billing and shipping
        address. Zircus can be contacted during business hours but if we are
        unable to facilitate an order change or cancellation request, you may
        process a return under our Comfort Guarantee policy.

      <summary>How do I wash my Zircus underwear?</summary>
      <p>
        Most garments can be machine washed with cold water and tumble dried
        with low heat on a gentle cycle. Note: only iron (low heat), bleach
        (using non-chlorine bleach), or dry clean when needed. These are general
        washing instructions and individual product pages/labels/packaging
        should be referenced for each style as washing instructions may vary
        slightly.
