## our story

Zircus Apparel is Queer owned and sewn with material that has the
Oeko-Tex certification. I hand make each pair in my home shop on
Vancouver Island. In this shop you won't see Women's or Men's used as
descriptions but instead each style of underwear is available in a flat
front, pouch front, or compression front.

## the method

We’ve flipped the script on traditional flatseam construction. Counter
to conventional methods, we reverse the stitching, placing the flatter,
softer side against the skin. This eliminates all unwanted chafe, itch
and friction.

## the style

All styles start with an ergonomic nine-panel construction to create 3D
support around glutes, thighs, quads and hamstrings. The seams that
connect each panel are strategically placed to eliminate chafing at
potential friction points. This means friction-free movement at every
angle (or in other words: absolute comfort).
