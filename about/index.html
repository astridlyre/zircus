      <h2>the story</h2>
      <p class="dot">
        Zircus Apparel is Queer owned and sewn with material that has the
        Oeko-Tex certification. I hand make each pair in my home shop on
        Vancouver Island. In this shop you won't see Women's or Men's used as
        descriptions but instead each style of underwear is available in a flat
        front, pouch front, or compression front.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>the method</h2>
      <p class="dot">
        We’ve flipped the script on traditional flatseam construction. Counter
        to conventional methods, we reverse the stitching, placing the flatter,
        softer side against the skin. This eliminates all unwanted chafe, itch
        and friction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>the style</h2>
      <p class="dot">
        All styles start with an ergonomic nine-panel construction to create 3D
        support around glutes, thighs, quads and hamstrings. The seams that
        connect each panel are strategically placed to eliminate chafing at
        potential friction points. This means friction-free movement at every
        angle (or in other words: absolute comfort).
