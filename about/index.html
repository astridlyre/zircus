      <p>
        Zircus Apparel is Queer owned and sewn with material that has the
        Oeko-Tex certification. I hand make each pair in my home shop on
        Vancouver Island. In this shop you won't see Women's or Men's used as
        descriptions but instead each style of underwear is available in a flat
        front, pouch front, or compression front.
