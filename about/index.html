        Zircus Apparel is Queer owned and sewn with material that has the
        Oeko-Tex certification. I hand make each pair in my home shop on
        Vancouver Island. In this shop you won't see Women's or Men's used as
        descriptions but instead each style of underwear is available in a flat
        front, pouch front, or compression front.

        It is important to measure yourself and not go from clothing sizes since
        fit can vary quite a lot from brand to brand. To ensure a great fit for
        your new pair of underwear please follow these directions and choose
        your corresponding size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take measurements while in your underwear, the measurement will be
        inaccurate if taken over clothing. Stand flat on your feet while holding
        a natural posture. Getting someone else to measure you would be easiest
        to tell if the measuring tape is level to the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Measure the circumference of your hips making sure the tape is over the
        largest part of your buttocks. This will be lower than where your pants
        sit. Start at one hip and wrap the tape measure around your rear, around
        the other hip, and back to where you started. Because it is difficult to
        make sure the tape is level behind you, you can use a mirror to check.
