Zircus Apparel is Queer owned and sewn with material that has the Oeko-Tex
certification. I hand make each pair in my home shop on Vancouver Island.
In this shop you won't see Women's or Men's used as descriptions but
instead each style of underwear is available in a flat front, pouch front,
or compression front.
