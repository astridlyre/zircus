### Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

While we do not track you, our third-party service providers (Stripe & PayPal)

Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your
computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit
your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the
toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from
accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new
cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with
a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies,
which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded
invisibly on web pages.

## Third-Party Sites And Services

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of
